**Ola Power BI Project**

**Overview**

The Ola Power BI Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization solution aimed at analyzing, tracking, and reporting on Ola's operational metrics. This project utilizes Power BI to integrate multiple data sources, clean, transform, and visualize them into interactive dashboards and reports. It provides insights into various aspects of Ola's business, including trip data, revenue, customer satisfaction, utilization rates, and more.

The solution is designed for Ola's stakeholders—such as management, operations teams, and finance departments—enabling them to make data-driven decisions, monitor business trends, and identify operational bottlenecks.

**Key Features**

Interactive Dashboards: Provides a clear, dynamic overview of critical KPIs (e.g., Total Revenue, Number of Trips, Driver Ratings).
Data Integration: Combines and integrates data from various sources, such as Ola’s internal databases, transaction logs, and external APIs (where applicable).
Data Transformation: Utilizes Power Query to clean, shape, and transform raw data into a more useful and digestible format for analysis.
Custom Visuals: Includes custom visuals, such as bar charts, line graphs, maps, and KPI indicators, to deliver actionable insights.
Trend Analysis: Visualize trends over time, including ride demand, revenue, customer satisfaction, and more.
Geospatial Analysis: Leverages maps to visualize trip data, identifying regional trends, hotspots, and optimizing driver placement.
Features

**1. Interactive Dashboards**

Total Revenue
Number of Trips
Driver Ratings
Average Trip Duration
Rider Satisfaction
These dashboards allow stakeholders to drill down into various data points and explore detailed insights.

**2. Data Integration****

Internal Databases: Direct connections to Ola's operational databases (SQL, CSV, or Excel files).
Transaction Logs: Data about individual trips, payment transactions, cancellations, etc.
External APIs (if applicable): Real-time data from third-party APIs (e.g., traffic data, weather conditions) that can impact ride demand.

**3. Data Transformation**

Using Power Query, the project cleans and shapes the raw data by:

Removing duplicates
Correcting data errors
Formatting dates and times correctly
Handling null values
Merging and appending datasets from multiple sources
